# Fragno Project Cursor Rules

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript monorepo containing a web framework (Fragno) and related packages. The project
follows a modular architecture with generic core implementations and framework-specific adapters.

## Project Structure

### Root Structure

- `packages/` - Main packages (fragno, chatno)
- `examples/` - Example applications and demos
- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
- Configuration files at root (tsconfig, eslint, prettier, etc.)

### Package Structure

- `packages/fragno/` - Core web framework
  - `src/api/` - Server-side API framework
  - `src/client/` - Client-side implementations
  - `src/mod.ts` - Main entry point
- `packages/chatno/` - Chat functionality package
- `examples/react-router-example/` - React Router integration example

## Architecture Principles

### Core + Adapters Pattern

- **CRITICAL**: Core implementations should be generic and framework-agnostic
- Framework-specific adapters (React, Vue, etc.) are created separately
- Keep the core API surface minimal and composable
- Adapters should be thin wrappers around core functionality

### File Organization

- `internal/` directories contain implementation details not exposed in public API
- `integrations/` directories contain framework-specific code
- Main exports go through `index.ts` or `mod.ts` files
- Types should be co-located with their implementations

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Do NOT use `any` unless absolutely necessary
- Use proper JSDoc comments for public APIs

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for file names
- Use PascalCase for component/class files
- Use lowercase for utility and helper files
- Internal files go in `internal/` subdirectories
- Tests are colocated, e.g. `route.ts` -> `route.test.ts`

### Import/Export Patterns

- Use named exports over default exports
- Re-export through index files for clean public APIs
- Keep internal imports separate from public API imports
- Use relative imports within packages, package imports across packages

## Package Guidelines

### Fragno Package (`packages/fragno/`)

- Core web framework functionality
- Split between API (server) and client implementations
- Should work with any JavaScript runtime/framework
- Keep React-specific code in separate adapter files

### Chatno Package (`packages/chatno/`)

- AI assistant chat functionality
- Should integrate cleanly with Fragno
- Follow same core + adapter pattern

### Examples

- Provide working examples for major integrations
- Keep examples simple but realistic
- Include proper configuration and setup

## Agent Development Guidelines

- Use `vitest` for testing: `bunx vitest` to run tests
- Do not run `vite`, or `bun run dev` to run the application. It's already running in the
  background.
