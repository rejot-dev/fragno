### Atomic Commits

Intelligently split current changes into multiple atomic commits that are logical, functional, and
follow best practices.

## Steps

1. Take into account the context of the current chat, it's likely commits are related to the current
   session.
1. Run `git status` to understand what files have changed
1. Run `git diff` (or read changed files) to analyze the nature of changes
1. Analyze and group changes into logical, atomic commits based on:
   - Related functionality (features that work together)
   - Change types (refactoring, new features, fixes, tests, docs)
   - Dependencies (what must come before what)
   - File relationships (changes that span multiple files for one feature)
1. Create a commit plan showing:
   - Commit order (numbered)
   - Commit message (with conventional commit format)
   - Commit description (brief explanation of the changes)
   - Files/changes included in each commit (use globs to keep it brief)
   - Changeset for commit, including version to increase (minor/patch)
1. Present the plan in a markdown code block
1. Ask: "If this looks good, say 'yes'. If you'd like to adjust the grouping or order, let me know
   what to change."
1. Iterate on feedback until the user approves
1. Create the changeset files
1. Execute the commits in order using `git add` (with specific files/patches as needed) and
   `git commit`
1. Create a changeset if the changes are relevant to end users of Fragno (see Changesets section)
1. After all commits are done, run `git log --oneline -n [number]` to show the final result
1. Respond with: "âœ“ Created [N] atomic commits" (and mention changeset if created) and show the log
   output

## Rules

### General

- DO NOT run destructive commands, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: `git reset`, `git clean`.
- DO NOT push
- ALWAYS keep tests, types, and docs together with the actual code that is being changed.
- Commit EVERYTHING unless something is gitignored.
- Each line of the commit message should be less than 72 characters.

### Commit Structure

- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `ci`, `build`
- Scopes are package based, commits can have multiple scopes.

### Packages Based Scopes:

[SCOPE] - [FOLDER]

- core - packages/fragno
- cli - apps/fragno-cli
- db - packages/fragno-db

- docs - apps/docs

- examples - example-apps/, example-fragments/

- create - packages/create, packages/create-cli

- node packages/fragno-node
- unplugin-fragno packages/unplugin-fragno

### Atomicity & Functionality

- **CRITICAL**: Each commit MUST leave the codebase in a working state
- Tests and types must work after each commit
- Features and their tests go together
- Type definitions and implementations go together
- Don't separate interdependent changes

### Logical Grouping

- Group by intent, not by file or change type
- Refactoring before features
- Infrastructure before code that uses it
- Bug fixes separate from new features when possible

### File Splitting

- Use `git add -p` when a single file contains multiple independent changes
- Only split when changes are truly independent
- When in doubt, keep related changes together

### Changesets

- The changeset file HAS TO BE part of the commit that includes the changes
- Create a changeset ONLY if the changes affect end users of Fragno (library authors or app
  developers using Fragno)
- DO create changesets for:
  - New features, APIs, or functionality
  - Bug fixes that affect user code
  - Breaking changes
- DO NOT create changesets for:
  - Internal refactoring that doesn't change public APIs
  - Test-only changes
  - Build tooling or CI updates
  - Development workflow improvements
  - Example app changes (unless they demonstrate new features)

## Analysis Guidelines

When analyzing changes, consider:

1. **Dependency order**: What must exist before other things can work?
1. **Test coverage**: Does the commit include tests that would pass?
1. **Type safety**: Do types and implementation go together?
1. **Semantic grouping**: Do these changes serve one clear purpose?
1. **Reversibility**: Could this commit be reverted cleanly if needed?
1. **Review clarity**: Would a reviewer understand this commit in isolation?

The goal is a git history that tells a clear story and allows easy debugging, reverting, and
cherry-picking.
