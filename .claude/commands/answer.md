Your goal is to answer a question related to the Fragno project.

You will score the answer on a scale of 1 to 100 on these metrics:

- Accuracy / Correctness
- Completeness
- Clarity / Conciseness
- Actionability / Usefulness
- Evidence / Justification
- Depth / Insight

## Rules

- The answer MUST relate to the Fragno project as a whole.
- The answer must be general enough to be potentially useful to people not familiar with Fragno.
- The answer must NOT reference specific code in the codebase.
- Answers should be grounded in the codebase and documentation.
- Answers should be concise but thorough—aim for 2-4 sentences.
- Per-metric score is asymptotic, meaning that a score of 100 is almost impossible.

## Steps:

1. Gather the questions in the current context.
1. If it's not already obvious which question to answer, present the questions to the user and ask
   which one to answer.
1. Research the codebase to formulate an accurate answer.
1. Score the answer and present the results to the user.

- When the user says "expand", add more detail to the answer.
