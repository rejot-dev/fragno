feat: add corpus command to view code examples and documentation

The new `corpus` command allows users and LLMs to access tested, type-checked code examples
organized by subject. Examples include route definition, database querying, and adapter setup. Use
`fragno-cli corpus [topic...]` to view one or more topics.
