| Term                               | Definition                                                                                                                                                      | Area     |

| **Dependencies**                   | Private server-side objects (like database connections, API clients) available to route handlers but not included in client bundles                             | Core     |
| **Fragment**                       | A full-stack library built with Fragno that contains both server-side API logic and client-side integration code                                                | Core     |
| **Services**                       | Public server-side functions exposed to Fragment users for use in custom handlers or background tasks                                                           | Core     |
| **Hooks**                          | React-style functions for reading data from GET routes, created via `createHook`                                                                                | Client   |
| **Mutators**                       | Client-side functions for modifying data through POST/PUT/DELETE routes, created via `createMutator`                                                            | Client   |
| **Adapters**                       | Framework-specific integration helpers that convert Fragno's standard handlers to work with specific frameworks                                                 | Server   |
| **Durable Hooks**                  | Side effects registered during a database transaction that are persisted and executed after commit, with automatic retries on failure                           | Database |
| **FragnoId**                       | A type that carries both ID and version information, used for optimistic concurrency control in database operations                                             | Database |
| **Optimistic Concurrency Control** | A concurrency control method that uses version checking to detect conflicts, automatically retrying transactions when conflicts occur                           | Database |
| **Unit of Work (UOW)**             | A two-phase transaction pattern where services enqueue reads/writes and route handlers execute them atomically, enabling composition and batching               | Database |
| **Code Splitting**                 | Automatic separation of client and server code during build time, removing server-side dependencies from client bundles                                         | Build    |
| **Unplugin**                       | A unified plugin system that supports Vite, Rollup, webpack, and other build tools, used by fragment authors throught the `@fragno-dev/unplugin-fragno` package | Build    |
