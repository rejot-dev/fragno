</Callout>

## Server-side

| Framework               | Support |

<Callout type="info" title="Web Standards">
  Fragno uses the web standard `Request` and `Response` objects, so frameworks _not_ listed here
  could be easily integrated regardless.
</Callout>

## Database Adapters

| Adapter | Support |
| ------- | ------- |
| Kysely  | ✅      |
| Drizzle | ✅      |
| Prisma  | ✅      |

The Prisma adapter generates `.prisma` schema output so you can use Prisma migrations and client
types. Fragno still executes queries via Kysely dialects.

### Kysely Dialects

Fragno's data layer executes queries using the Kysely query builder. This is true even when using
the Drizzle adapter, which is exclusively used to generate schema files to integrate directly with
the user's existing Drizzle schema.

Kysely's dialect interface is relatively easy to implement, and there are already many first- and
third-party dialects available. You can find a list of supported dialects
[here](https://kysely.dev/docs/dialects).
