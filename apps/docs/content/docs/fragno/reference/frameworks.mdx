<Callout type="info" title="Web Standards">
  Fragno uses the web standard `Request` and `Response` objects, so frameworks _not_ listed here
  could be easily integrated regardless.
</Callout>

## Database Integration

Fragno uses a single runtime adapter (`SqlAdapter`) built on Kysely dialects. Schema output formats
are explicit:

| Output Format  | Support |
| -------------- | ------- |
| SQL migrations | ✅      |
| Drizzle schema | ✅      |
| Prisma schema  | ✅      |

Use `fragno-cli db generate --format drizzle` or `--format prisma` for schema outputs. SQL
migrations remain the default.

### Kysely Dialects

Fragno's data layer executes queries using the Kysely query builder. This is true even when using
Drizzle or Prisma workflows, which use schema outputs to integrate with your existing tooling.

Kysely's dialect interface is relatively easy to implement, and there are already many first- and
third-party dialects available. You can find a list of supported dialects
[here](https://kysely.dev/docs/dialects).
