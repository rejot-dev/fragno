## Hooks

```ts
const {
  useFiles,
  useFile,
  useCreateUpload,
  useUploadStatus,
  useCompleteUpload,
  useAbortUpload,
  useUpdateFile,
  useDeleteFile,
} = uploadClient;
```

## Helpers

The helper API wraps the common end-to-end flows. It is exposed as a reactive store hook in
supported frameworks.

```ts
const { useUploadHelpers } = uploadClient;
const helpers = useUploadHelpers();

await helpers.createUploadAndTransfer(file, {
  keyParts: ["teams", teamId, "logo"],
  onProgress: ({ bytesUploaded, totalBytes }) => {
    console.log(bytesUploaded, totalBytes);
  },
});
```

### `createUploadAndTransfer`

- Creates an upload.
- Chooses direct single, direct multipart, or server-streamed (proxy) uploads based on the server
  response.
- Tracks progress for multipart and server-streamed (proxy) uploads.

### `downloadFile`

```ts
const response = await helpers.downloadFile(["teams", teamId, "logo"]);
const blob = await response.blob();
```

Uses signed download URLs when supported, otherwise falls back to `/files/:fileKey/content`.
