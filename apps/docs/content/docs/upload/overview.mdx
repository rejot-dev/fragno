description: What the Upload fragment provides out of the box.

## What you get

- **File + upload data model**: Separate file and upload records with statuses, metadata, and
  lifecycle timestamps.
- **Multiple upload strategies**: direct single/multipart to S3-backed storage, or server-streamed
  (proxy) uploads to file storage, depending on adapter capabilities and file size.
- **Storage adapters**: S3-backed adapters (AWS S3 / R2) and a Node filesystem adapter.
- **Hooks for lifecycle events**: `onFileReady`, `onUploadFailed`, and `onFileDeleted`.
- **Client helpers**: A higher-level API for direct and server-streamed (proxy) uploads with
  progress reporting.

## Typical flow

1. Create an upload with `POST /uploads`.
2. Transfer file bytes (direct single, direct multipart, or server-streamed proxy).
3. Complete the upload and move the file to `ready`.
4. Fetch metadata or download the file when needed.

## When to use server-streamed vs direct

- **Direct (S3-backed)**: Best for large files and reducing server bandwidth. Requires a signed
  URL-capable storage adapter.
- **Server-streamed (file storage)**: Best for smaller files or when storage credentials cannot be
  exposed to clients. The server proxies bytes to storage.
