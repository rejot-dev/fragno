Use run events, webhook records, and artifact views to understand what happened.

## Run events

Replay persisted events to debug a run lifecycle:

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/runs/run_123/events"
```

Tip: `run.final` includes the final status and error details.

## Streaming issues

- If a stream disconnects, check the run events to confirm completion.
- `run.status` and `run.final` explain why a run failed or cancelled.

## Webhook issues

- Confirm the webhook secret matches OpenAI.
- Verify your environment exposes `globalThis.crypto` (Node 22+).
- Check `ai_openai_webhook_event.processingError` for the last failure.

## Common fixes

### Runs never start

- Ensure a dispatcher is configured and running.
- If using HTTP ticks, enable `enableRunnerTick` and call `/_runner/tick`.

### Deep research never completes

- Verify that OpenAI is sending webhooks to `/ai/webhooks/openai`.
- Ensure the run is `waiting_webhook` and the response ID is stored.
