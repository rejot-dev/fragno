Artifacts store structured outputs from deep research runs. They are persisted alongside run and
message data and can be retrieved via the artifact routes.

## Artifact shape

Deep research artifacts use `type: "deep_research_report"` and include:

- `data.reportMarkdown`: the final report markdown.
- `data.modelId`: the model used.
- `data.openaiResponseId`: the OpenAI response ID.
- `data.usage`: token usage (if provided by OpenAI).
- `data.rawResponse`: full response payload when `persistOpenAIRawResponses` is enabled.

## Routes

- `GET /runs/:runId/artifacts`
- `GET /artifacts/:artifactId`

## Notes

Artifacts are capped by `limits.maxArtifactBytes`. Oversized reports fail the run with
`ARTIFACT_TOO_LARGE`.
