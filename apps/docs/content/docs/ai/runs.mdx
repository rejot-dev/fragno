Runs execute model work against a thread. They can be foreground streams or background jobs.

## Run types

- `agent`: standard assistant execution (stream or background).
- `deep_research`: background-only, completes via webhook and produces an artifact.

## Execution modes

- `foreground_stream`: uses `/runs:stream` and emits NDJSON events.
- `background`: queued and processed by the runner.

## Statuses

- `queued`: waiting for the runner.
- `running`: actively executing.
- `waiting_webhook`: deep research submitted, waiting for OpenAI webhook.
- `processing_webhook`: webhook claimed and retrieving the response.
- `succeeded`: completed successfully.
- `failed`: terminal with error.
- `cancelled`: cancelled by request.

## Creating runs

Use `POST /threads/:threadId/runs` for background runs and `POST /threads/:threadId/runs:stream` for
streaming runs. Provide overrides such as `modelId`, `thinkingLevel`, or `systemPrompt`.

## Retries

Background runs use exponential backoff based on `retries.maxAttempts` and `retries.baseDelayMs`.
Runs track `attempt`, `maxAttempts`, and `nextAttemptAt` for scheduling.
