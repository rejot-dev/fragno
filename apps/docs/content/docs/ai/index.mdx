Fragno AI provides a durable, OpenAI-backed execution layer with threads, runs, NDJSON streaming,
background research, and webhook-backed completion.

## Key concepts

- Threads store messages and default model configuration.
- Runs execute model work and emit events.
- Deep research runs complete via webhook and produce artifacts.
