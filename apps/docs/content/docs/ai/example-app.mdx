The AI fragment ships with an example app for debugging and learning. It uses React Router, Drizzle
and PGLite, with intentionally open endpoints (no auth).

## What it includes

- Thread list + detail view
- Message and run history
- Streaming panel with live text and events
- Deep research run flow and artifact viewer
- 1s polling for background updates

## Notes

This app is intended for local development and debugging. Do not deploy it without adding proper
authentication and rate limiting.
