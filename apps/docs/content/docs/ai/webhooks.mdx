Deep research runs complete via OpenAI webhooks. The fragment exposes a single webhook endpoint for
OpenAI Responses events.

## Configure OpenAI

- Set `webhookSecret` in your fragment config.
- Register `POST /api/ai/webhooks/openai` in the OpenAI dashboard (fragment routes mount under
  `/api/<fragment-name>/...`).

## Delivery flow

1. OpenAI calls the webhook route.
2. The fragment verifies the signature and stores the event idempotently.
3. A durable wake-up notifies the runner to process the event.
4. The runner retrieves the Response and persists the artifact and final message.

## Notes

- The webhook route is server-only and should be protected at the host level.
- Use `rateLimiter` with scope `webhook_openai` to apply rate limits.
- Webhooks are fast: no OpenAI fetch happens during the HTTP request.
