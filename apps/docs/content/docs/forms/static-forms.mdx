## Overview

The form fragment supports two approaches for defining forms: dynamic forms (schema stored in the
database) and static forms (schema defined in code). Both approaches store submissions in your
database.

Static forms are useful when you want to version control your form definitions alongside application
code.

Static forms are treated by the API the same as a dynamic form, with the exception that UPDATE and
PATCH routes will not function.

## Static vs Dynamic Forms

| Aspect      | Static Forms                      | Dynamic Forms                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Schema      | Defined in code, passed to config | Stored in database                |
| ID          | Developer-defined                 | Auto-generated UUID               |
| Version     | Developer-managed                 | Auto-incremented on schema update |
| Status      | Always `static`                   | `draft`, `open`, or `closed`      |
| Submissions | Stored in database                | Stored in database                |
| Modifiable  | Yes, with code change             | Yes, through API call             |
| Source      | Codebase                          | Database                          |

## Defining Static Forms

Static forms are passed to the `createFormsFragment` function through the
`staticForms: StaticForm[]` key.

```ts
import type { StaticForm } from "@fragno-dev/forms";
import { createFormsFragment } from "@fragno-dev/forms";

const myStaticForms: StaticForm[] = [
  {
    id: "support-contact-form",
    slug: "contact",
    title: "Contact Us",
    version: 1, // Increment on dataSchema changes
    description: "Get in touch with our support team.",
    dataSchema: {
      /* JSON Schema definition */
    },
    uiSchema: undefined, // optional
  },
];

/* ... */

createFormsFragment(
  {
    ...configs,
    staticForms: myStaticForms,
  },
  { databaseAdapter },
);
```

## ID, Version, and Slug

### ID

The `id` is a unique identifier for the form. For static forms, this is defined in the code. If you
change the `id`, then all form submissions for that id will not be linked to your form.

If an `id` clashes with a dynamically created form, the static form takes precedence.

For dynamic forms, the ID is a UUID generated when the form is created through the admin API.

### Version

The `version` tracks schema changes. Incrementing the version on a form will indicate a new data
schema, but keep past form submissions linked. Submissions keep track of which version of the form
it was submitted for.

For static forms, the version is managed manually. Increment it when you make changes to your data
schema.

For dynamic forms, the version auto-increments each time the form is updated through the API.

### Slug

The `slug` is the public-facing identifier used in URLs. Forms are fetched via `/:slug`, so your
slug becomes part of your public API. Slugs can be changed freely.

Both static and dynamic forms use slugs the same way. If a static form and dynamic form share the
same slug, the static form takes precedence.
