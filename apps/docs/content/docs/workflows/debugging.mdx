Use workflow history and logs to understand what happened and why a workflow is waiting or failed.

## History and logs

The history endpoint returns step results, events, and optional log lines.

```bash
curl \"$BASE_URL/workflows/approval/instances/inst_123/history?includeLogs=true\"
```

Tips:

- Use `includeLogs=true` to include workflow log lines.
- Filter logs with `logLevel` and `logCategory`.
- Use `order=desc` to read newest entries first.

## Common issues

### Instance never runs

- Ensure the dispatcher is configured and running.
- If using HTTP ticks, confirm `enableRunnerTick: true` and that `/_runner/tick` is being called.

### Stuck in waiting

- Verify the event `type` matches the workflow's `waitForEvent` call.
- Use the history view to see buffered events and the wait step details.

### Repeated retries or timeouts

- Check `timeout` and `maxAttempts` in the step definition.
- Look for the latest error in history; it includes the error name and message.

### Pause/resume not changing status

- The pause request is respected on the next tick; make sure the runner is still running.
- If the instance is terminal (`complete`, `terminated`, `errored`), it will not resume.

## When to open an issue

If the instance is in a non-terminal state but no tasks are being processed, capture:

- the instance status and metadata
- history output (with logs)
- runner/dispatcher configuration
