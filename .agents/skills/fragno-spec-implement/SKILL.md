# Fragno Spec Implement

## Overview

Implement spec-defined work using FP issues as the plan of record. The spec defines scope and
acceptance criteria; FP issues define tasks, dependencies, and status.

## Workflow

1. Identify the relevant spec via `specs/INDEX.md` and read it before starting.
2. Use FP to find the related issues and select the next unblocked task.
3. Claim the task, implement changes, and keep the spec in sync if decisions change.
4. Comment progress in FP, then mark the issue done when complete.
