- study specs/README.md
- use the $fp-implement skill to find and claim a todo issue (fp tree / fp issue list)
- load context for the chosen issue (fp context <ID>) before coding
- comment progress on the issue as you work (fp comment <ID> "...")
- make sure new code is well tested
- after ALL tests pass, lint checks and types check, commit and push
- follow conventional commits, study specs/COMMIT.md
- make sure to mark the issue as done when you finish it (fp issue update --status done <ID>)
- when ALL issues are finished (all have status "done"), write only:
  <promise>TASKS_FINISHED</promise>
