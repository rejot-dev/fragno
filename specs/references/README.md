# References

This folder stores snapshots of external or local reference material used while writing specs. See
`specs/README.md` for the rules around capturing references.

## Guidelines

- Add only the material needed to support the spec; keep it scoped.
- Name files clearly (source + topic + date if helpful).
- Note the original source (URL or local path) in the spec and/or a short header comment in the
  reference file.
