on @apps/docs/app/routes/home.tsx i've commented out the upload and auth fragments. Add them back in but without details and some sort of coming soon message. They are not clickable

---

by not clickable I mean there isn't a big version, not that there is not link on the big version. Gray them out in the side bar
