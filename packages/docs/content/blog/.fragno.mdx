## Libraries are not sufficient

- Traditional libraries integrate on _either_ the front-end _or_ the back-end, the library user is
  responsible for the glue-code.
- There are many cases where this is not sufficient.
- When the domain is split between front-end and back-end, there's a lot of re-implementation needed
  per project.
- For example:
  - AI/LLM Chat: user-interaction is key on the front-end, but also requires a back-end component to
    handle API keys and function calling.
  - Authentication: login forms, redirects on the front-end, back-end for verification and retrieval
    of data from third-party providers.
- Another area where traditional libraries are not sufficient is when there is a lot of integration
  between back-end services.
- For example:
  - Payments: receiving updates from the payment provider is key to follow the customer lifecycle.
  - Email: send emails, track bounces, open rates
- AI "Deep Research" is an example that has both. Front-end interaction to set up the research,
  back-end integration for function calls and webhooks for updates from the LLM provider.
- Even "pure" back-end libraries that don't really need any front-end work can be improved by having
  a more full-stack mindset. Imagine an API-first/API-only company that only provides one route that
  verifies if a person's name corresponds to a bank-account number. Presumably this would be
  integrated in some flow involving the user. A case is bound to come up where someone on the
  support staff wants to verify the result of this check. To do that we would need an engineer to
  create an API route on the internal back-end service, then a page on the front-end to display the
  result. If the library was full-stack, the API provider could simply provide a front-end function
  `verifyNameToBankAccount` that would call the internal back-end and forward to the provider. In
  this example, we're moving integration work from the library user, to the library author.
