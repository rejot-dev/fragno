# Services

Services are functions exposed by the Fragment author to the user. Their purpose is to be called on
the server, such as in loader functions or background processing.

## Basic Usage

The `services` object is available on the Fragment server-side instance.

```typescript title="jobs/my-background-process.ts"
import { createExampleFragmentInstance } from "../lib/example-fragment-server";

export async function myBackgroundProcess() {
  const { getHashFromHostsFileData } = createExampleFragmentInstance().services;

  setInterval(
    () => {
      const hash = getHashFromHostsFileData();
      console.log("Hash of hosts file:", hash);
    },
    /* every hour */ 1000 * 60 * 60,
  );
}
```
