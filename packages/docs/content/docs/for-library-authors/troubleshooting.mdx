## TypeScript Errors

### Error TS2742: The inferred type of `T` cannot be named without a reference to `T`. This is likely not portable. A type annotation is necessary.

Since Fragno uses complex types extensively, TypeScript will sometimes be unable to infer types of
the Fragno library definition or client-side object. Usually, a simple type annotation fixes this
problem. However, since we want the types to be inferred, we need to re-export the type from the
Fragno package.

In the file that exports the Fragno library definition or client-side object, add the following
line:

```typescript
export type { FragnoRouteConfig } from "@fragno-dev/core/api";
```

In some cases, it might be another type that is causing the error. In that case, you can add the
type annotation to the specific type that is causing the error. Unfortunately, there is no
consistent way to determine which type is causing the error.
