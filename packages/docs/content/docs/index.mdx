Fragno is the toolkit for building full-stack TypeScript libraries that work seamlessly across
different frameworks such as Next.js and Nuxt.

With Fragno:

- **Library authors** write API routes and client-side hooks/logic as part of their library.
- **Users** integrate a library into their application in a couple lines of code. They can then
  immediately use library functionality from both the frontend and the backend.

A library built with Fragno is called a **Fragment**.

## Fragments

A **Fragment** is a full-stack **library** that:

- Contains both server-side API logic and client-side integration code
- Works across multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt, [etc.](./docs/frameworks))
- Provides end-to-end functionality: type-safe & reactive

Fragments enable the Fragment-author to write API routes as a library that are **embedded** into the
user's project. Fragno also provides building blocks for the Fragment-author to create client-side
integration that is automatically reactive. Fragno's main goal is to make integrating into a user's
project as simple as possible.

**This differs from traditional libraries** in the sense that a library would usually be imported
either on the server or client side, and the user would be responsible for the glue-code.

## Benefits

Compared to traditional libraries, Fragno libraries provide:

- **Instant** integration for users: no glue-code required
- **Frictionless** usage from both the frontend and the backend
- **Fully integrated** experiences for amazing developer experience

Fragno is the most **developer-friendly** way to help users adopt your API.

## Features

- üîê **End-to-end type safety**: routes are typed using Standard Schema and client-side hooks are
  fully type-safe
- üöÄ **Built-in state management**: reactive stores with caching built in (TanStack Query-style),
  using [Nano Stores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)
- üîÑ **Middleware support**: Users can use middleware for custom request processing such as
  authentication.
- üåä **Streaming support**: Real-time data with NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON) streaming
- üì¶ **Automatic code splitting**: code is split on the library level, no added build complexity for
  end-users.

## What's Next?

Fragno's documentation is split into two parts: one for **users** and one for **library authors**.

Continue to the next page for the [User Quick Start](./docs/user-quick-start), where you'll learn
how to integrate a Fragment into your project. Or continue to the
[For Library Authors](./docs/for-library-authors/getting-started) section to learn how to build your
own Fragno fragments.
