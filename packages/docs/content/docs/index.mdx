Fragno is the <u>fr</u>amework-<u>agno</u>stic toolkit for building full-stack TypeScript libraries
that work seamlessly across different frameworks such as Next.js and Nuxt. Your users will integrate
in a couple lines of code. Write your API once, get type-safe clients for React, Vue, and vanilla
JavaScript automatically.

A library built with Fragno is called a **Fragment**.

## Fragments

A **Fragment** is a full-stack **library** that:

- Contains both server-side API logic and client-side integration code
- Works across multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt, etc.)
- Provides end-to-end type safety

Fragments enabled the Fragment-author to write API routes as a library, that will be **embedded**
into the user's project. Fragno also provides a method for the Fragment-author to create a
client-side integration that's automatically reactive. Fragno's main goal is to make integrating
into a user's project as simple as possible.

**This differs from traditional libraries** in the sense that a library would usually be imported
either on the server or client side, and the user would be responsible for the glue-code.

## What's Next?

Fragno's documentation is split up into two parts, one for **users** and one for **library
authors**.

Continue to the next page for the [User Quick Start](./docs/user-quick-start), where you'll learn
how to integrate a Fragment into your project. Or continue to the
[For Library Authors](./docs/for-library-authors/getting-started) section to learn how to build your
own Fragno fragments.
