# What is Fragno?

Fragno is the <u>fr</u>amework-<u>agno</u>stic toolkit for building full-stack TypeScript libraries
that work seamlessly across different frameworks and environments. Your users will integrate in a
single line of code. Write your API once, get type-safe clients for React, Vue, and vanilla
JavaScript automatically. Fully type safe.

## Fragments

A **Fragment** is a full-stack library that:

- Contains both server-side API logic and client-side integration code
- Works across multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt, etc.)
- Provides end-to-end type safety

Fragments enabled the Fragment-author to write API routes as a library, that will be **embedded**
into the user's project. Fragno also provides a method for the Fragment-author to create a
client-side integration that's automatically reactive.

**This differs from traditional libraries** in the sense that a library would usually be imported
either on the server or client side, and the user would be responsible for the glue-code.

## As a User

Fragno aims to make it as simple as possible to integrate Fragments into your project. These are
usage instructions for integrating a Fragment into a **Next.js** project. Integrating with other
frameworks is very similar, continue to the "For Users" documentation for details on your preferred
framework.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Installation

Install the fragment you want to use:

```npm
npm i @fragno-dev/example-fragment
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create an instance of the Fragment
Create an instance of the Fragment, somewhere central in your codebase:

This is the place where the Fragment is configured by passing Fragment-specific config fields such
as API keys, but also callback methods.

```ts title="lib/example-fragment-server.ts"
import { createExampleFragment } from "@fragno-dev/example-fragment";

export function createExampleFragmentInstance() {
  return createExampleFragment({
    // Pass any Fragment-specific config fields
    someApiKey: process.env.EXAMPLE_API_KEY!,
  });
}
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Mount the API routes
The API routes defined in the Fragment should be accessible from your frontend. We do this by 
creating a "catch-all" API route that will (in this case) forward all requests starting with 
`/api/example-fragment` to the Fragment.

We're using file-based routing in Next.js in this example, so the location of this file is
important.

```ts title="app/api/example-fragment/[...all]/route.ts"
import { toNextJsHandler } from "@fragno-dev/core/next-js";
import { createExampleFragmentInstance } from "@/lib/example-fragment-server";

export const { GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE } = toNextJsHandler(createExampleFragmentInstance());
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create a client-side integration

Again in a central place, but now for the client-side integration:

```ts title="lib/example-fragment-client.ts"
import { createExampleFragmentClient } from "@fragno-dev/example-fragment";

const exampleFragmentClient = createExampleFragmentClient();
export const exampleFragment = useFragno(exampleFragmentClient);
```

<Callout type="info">
  You're free to mount the backend routes on a different route. In that case it's important to pass
  the `mountRoute` option to the client-side integration.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Use the Fragment!

You can now use the Fragment in any of your components:

```ts title="components/ExampleComponent.tsx"
import { exampleFragment } from "@/lib/example-fragment-client";

export default function ExampleComponent() {
  const { useData } = exampleFragment;
  const { data, loading } = useData();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Example Component</h1>
      {loading ? <div>Loading...</div> : <div>{data}</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Step>

</Steps>
